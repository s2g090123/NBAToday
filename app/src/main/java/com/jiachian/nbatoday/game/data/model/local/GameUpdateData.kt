/**
 * Data for each game needs to be aggregated through two different APIs,
 * 1. Fetch the season schedule from `static/json/staticData/scheduleLeagueV2_32.json`
 *    (which contains basic data about the schedule).
 * 2. Retrieve specific game data, including leaders' statistics,
 *    for each game on a given date through `stats/scoreboardv3`.
 *
 * Therefore,
 * during the initialization phase (when the app has not obtained any data yet),
 * the database is initialized through (1).
 * Subsequently,
 * more detailed data is obtained by using (2) based on the current date and estimating a few days before and after.
 * This Data Class is designed to update the data from (2) into the previously fetched data from (1).
